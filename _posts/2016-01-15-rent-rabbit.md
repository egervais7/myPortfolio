##About Rent-Rabbit

The purpose of Rent Rabbit is to allow members to rent gear that they are not using to other members that only need something temporarily or are wanting to give a piece of equipment a test run before purchasing.

RR allows signed up users to post items for rent as well as search available items posted by other users. Once a transaction has taken place, users are encouraged to rate and review their experience to better inform future interaction.
