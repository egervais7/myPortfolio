## About SEC Seattle

A single page website built for Sterling Electrical Contractors. It is built with Jekyll and Liquid Templating, as well as Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It gives the owners of the company easy access to update and add data to the page through markdown files. They are contributors on git hub and can easily add a project that the company has done or add a new career posting.

It was built along with Dustin Graves and was around 12 hours of work. SEC is still updating the information, but the page is viewable through <a href="http://secseattle.github.io">secseattle.github.io</a>.

The source code is viewable at <a href="http://github.com/secseattle/secseattle.github.io">github.com/secseattle/secseattle.github.io</a>
