--About Word Search--

This word search game was my first big assignment at General Assembly. It was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery only.

After only 2 weeks of learning, I had to make a game and this is what I chose to create. It uses localStorage to save the top scores locally. It was a challenging first assignment, but looking back now, I know much better ways to create games and make working code. This was a great kick off to my learning experience at General Assembly.

You can play it at <a href="http://egervais7.github.io/firstGameProject/">http://egervais7.github.io/firstGameProject/</a>
