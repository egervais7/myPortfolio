--About Hiker Man--
<hr>

HikingMan is an online game made with Phaser and Meteor. It was built for the final project during General Assemblies Web Development Immersive Program. Go play it at <a href="http://hikerman.meteor.com">http://hikerman.meteor.com</a>. It may take a moment to load, but see if you can find the Pink Unicorn!

You can go see my code <a href="https://github.com/egervais7/hikingMan">here</a>

Phaser.io is a fast, free and fun HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of Pixi.js for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. There are tons of tutorials and examples that make creating a game very easy.

If you want to make a game with Phaser, go to their repo, Phaser Repo, clone it and download the phaser.js and phaser.min.js so you can get started!

Meteor is a very simple way to create a real time, full Javascript Apps. Go check them out! I used it to give players an option to add their top scores and initials to the database.
