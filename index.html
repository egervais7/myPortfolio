      <h3><a href="http://hikerman.meteor.com/">Hiker Man</a></h3>
      <p>Hiker Man was built with Phaser.io as my fourth project while at General Assembly. It also uses Meteor.js to make this a MEMN stack app. Meteor connects MongoDB to my front end to display a sorted list of Top Scores. Players can add their top score to the list once completing their game. It was a very fun game to build and was exciting to build with Phaser.io and Meteor.js, both of which, had not beed covered in my course when I made the game.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://wa-salaries-api.herokuapp.com">WA-Salaries API</a></h3>
      <p>WA-Salaries was an API built by myself, <a href="http://www.erinmoony.com">Erin Moon</a>, and <a href="http://www.jameschi.com">James Chi</a> during a one day hack-a-thon in our Web Development Course. We used Angular.js for our framework and MongoDB to store all our data. All the data can all be accesed with our api url. It was an exciting day working on getting this to work with many hold-ups, but we pulled through and got our API up and working. Creating this over a single day was a fantastic experience.</p>

      <p>Rent-Rabbit was built by myself, <a href="#">Alex Winn</a>, <a href="#">Seth Chute</a> and <a href="http://www.jameschi.com">James Chi</a> while in the Web Development Immersive program. If users have electronics laying around that they don't use, but would never get rid of, Rent-Rabbit gives them a way to rent them out. It was built with Ruby on Rails and Postgress SQl database as a RESTful app. It was a great project to do as a group and taught us more of the uses of GitHub for group collaboration.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://woodiesapp.herokuapp.com">Woodies</a></h3>
      <p>My Woodies app was the first project I had while taking my Web Development course. It uses Node.js and Express, as well as Postress SQL database interaction. This app gives a platform for people that are interested in woodworking, but don't know much about it yet. They can come to Woodies to find the information in one spot. Lots of the information comes from AJAX calls and I was also able to use the Pinterest API. It was a fun first app to make and can hopefully give people a way to get started on their first woodworking project.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://egervais7.github.io/firstGameProject/">Word Search</a></h3>
      <p>This word search game was our first big assignment at General Assembly. It was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery only. After only 2 weeks of learning, we had to make a game and this is what I chose to create. It uses localStorage to save the top scores locally. It was a challenging first assignment, but looking back now, I know much better was to create games and make working code. This was a great kick off to my learning experience at General Assembly.</p>
